Dear New Rapid <%= @user_type %>,

Thank you for becoming a new rapid <%= @user_type %>.

Your account has been activated.  
Under your account:
    Your email is listed as <%= @email %>
    Your temporary user alias is <%= @user_alias %>, which will be publicly displayed with your other provided item details, not your address information.

For 90 days your item record will remain on the Echo Market database. 

Thereafter, your item will be deleted from our records.  In the meantime, I recommend that you become a registered <%= @user_type %> so that you can enjoy the full functionality of Echo Market.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,

Liz McGurty
Founder/Owner/Coder of the Echo Market
