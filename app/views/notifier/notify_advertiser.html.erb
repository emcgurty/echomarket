Dear New Echo Market Advertiser,  <%= @title %>,

Thank you for becoming a Echo Market Advertiser!

Under your account:
    Your advertiser's Echo Market contact email is listed as <%= @email %>
    Your advertiser's URL is listed as <%= @url %>
    Your advertisement Contents is:
     <%= @description %>

Your advertisment will be displayed attractively and prominently on initial load of Echo Market for free...

On a calendar monthly basis, free advertising requires that from your contacts at least one individual/organization creates some combination of four of new borrowing or lending records.

In creating those records they and actually other Echo Market Borrowers/Lenders will be able to identify you as their Echo Market reference.  In this fairly simple process, you will gain so much visibility. Echo Market continues to be sought by thousands of returning and new users and dozens of search engines.

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.  And, for the moment you will have to contact me to alter or discontinue your advertisement.

Legal matters:  You are participating in a 'Free Advertising' Promotion to develop Echo Market listings of items to borrow or lend.  The terms and conditions of this promotion are subject to change; Echo Market will make reasonable effort to inform you of these changes.  

Thanks,

Liz McGurty
