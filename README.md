Goodwill resource for lending, borrowing, trading and donating nonperishable/ethical items

Originally I created this web-site in Netbeans 6.9.1, Ruby 1.8.7, and Rails 3.0.3

I have since ported my code to Aptana Studio 3.  Like the feel of Aptana IDE, but I have still yet to figure out how to debug with breakpoints.

I built this web-site in my spare-time.  I know that it is not perfect.... Largely becuase I live frugally in a very rural area, aside from the Internet limited resources.  Nevertheless, I feel very commited to the notion of item sharing... I know that that application needs much more:

1.)  A map visualization of where lenders and borrower are
2.)  I need to improve the search to allow for items for trade and donation, just a matter of changing the SQL...  In Netbeans I was able to get associations to work.
3.)  I am offering very plain styling...  I know I need to make the site more visually appealing.  Kind of ironic becuase I am actually a pretty decent artist, but I lack so much confidence in electonic drawing..
4.)  I know that I need to resize for different screen sizes. I generally understand the process, but uncertain as to DOM object requirement in each screen.
5.)  I realize that the site is not complete with regard to error management, asset config, and and general config settings.
6.)  Then there are the more sophisticated matters of need for threading...

Sincerely,

Liz McGurty
