Goodwill resource for lending, borrowing, trading and donating nonperishable/ethical items

Originally I created this web-site in Netbeans 6.9.1, Ruby 1.8.7, and Rails 3.0.3

GOOD NEWS:  For the longest time I was not able to implement Rails Model Associations... I guess in my inexperience and lack of reliable information, I choose to sort of 'force' model results.  Now suddenly in having become involved with numerous ROR resources, I finally got some really excellent direction/instruction.  So at the moment I am re-writing this site to reflect my understanding...

TODO:

1.)  A map visualization of where lenders and borrower are

2.)  I am offering very plain styling...  I know I need to make the site more visually appealing.  Kind of ironic becuase I am actually a pretty decent artist, but I lack so much confidence in electronic drawing..

3.)  I realize that the site is not complete with regard to error management, asset config, and general config settings.

4.)  Then there are the more sophisticated matters of need for threading, caching, haven't figured out sprokets yet, and generally explore gems that may be best for the site, ...

Sincerely,

Liz McGurty
